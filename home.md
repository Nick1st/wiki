No matter if you're a player, modpack-creator or developer using my mods and want to find out how things work, this is the right place for you!

# Navigation
To navigate through the docs, use the sidebar far left.
There are two navigation modes currently available. The `Browse` mode is helpfull when looking for a certain page, while the `Main Menu` mode is best for quick discovery of the most important wiki pages.

## Browse mode
This navigation is alphabetically ordered by mods. Inside a mod folder there may be different mod versions, as features can change depending on version. 

> Please make sure you're on the correct page for the version you're using.
{.is-info}

_For example:_
If you want to see the docs for FancyVideo-API v2, click on the `FancyVideo-API` folder and then on the `v2` directory in the sidebar.
For FancyVideo-API v3, use the `v3` directory instead.

## Main Menu mode
This navigation is grouped by mods and contains the most important pages per mod only.

> This navigation will _**always**_ point to the latest version of a mod publicly available!
{.is-warning}

_For example:_
If you want to access the `Getting Started` page for FancyVideo-API, search for the FancyVideo-API section in the sidebar and then click the `Getting Started` page.
